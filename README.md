# Python Tetris Game

## Project Description
This project is a classic implementation of the Tetris game, developed using Python and the pygame library. It offers both a desktop version and a web version, allowing players to enjoy Tetris on their preferred platform. The game includes features such as score tracking, next block preview, and a pause/resume functionality.

## Game Overview
Tetris is a puzzle video game where players must arrange falling blocks, called Tetrominoes, into complete rows. Each Tetromino is made up of four squares, and the player can move them left, right, or down, as well as rotate them, to fit them into the grid. When a row is completely filled with blocks, it disappears, and the player earns points. the game ends when the stack of Tetrominoes reaches the top of the grid.
